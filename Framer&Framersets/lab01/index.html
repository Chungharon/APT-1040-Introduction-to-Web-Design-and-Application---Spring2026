        <h1>Renewable Energy</h1>
        
        <h2>Clean Power for a Sustainable Future</h2>
        <p>Renewable energy comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished, including solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        
        <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
        <p>Solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity. Advances in photovoltaic technology have made solar power increasingly affordable and efficient, making it one of the fastest-growing energy sources worldwide.</p>
        
        <h2>Wind Power</h2>
        <p>Wind turbines harness the kinetic energy of moving air to generate electricity. Both onshore and offshore wind farms are becoming major contributors to global energy production.</p>
        
        <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>Transitioning to renewable energy is crucial for combating climate change, reducing air pollution, and creating sustainable energy systems for future generations. The renewable energy sector also creates millions of jobs worldwide.</p>
